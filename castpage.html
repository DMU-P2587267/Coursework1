<!-- I've saved the images of the cast members with their name so that it was easier to type in and for the browser to find in my img folder.
    Also, as the file format of the image was a jpg, I added .jpg at the end of the src element.
    The reasoning for the alt is because if the the image doesn't load up for the viewer, the alt atribute gives text in place of the image say what's there.
