<!-- On the index page, for the footer I decided to change it up and add extra information on it that you would see see on websites like including contact information for the user to use if they have an inquiry or want to take part in an event such as a contest or giveaway.
     For the contacts I used an email and phone number linked in using the <a> element that links other sites, pages or links via creating a unique URl .
     The href is included in the <a> element as it's the actual link and text that you can select which takes you to where it says it will take you. For my site, by pressing the phone number it will pop up with a message on your phone asking if you want  to call the number or not. If you press the email, it will open up whatever program you use to view emails which could be outlook, gmail or yahoo and start a draft for you to write to the email shown on the website.
     I added the copyright at the bottom because copyright is added at the end of everything whether it's a website, video or post so that it shows that it's original and you'd be in troubble if you steal it or use it as your own.
